		 			        Kick is designed to work with a wide variety of startups, so the answer is likely yes.
		 			        There are just three expectations that should be met before applying:
		 			        <ul>
		 			        <li>You should already have a problem that you are trying to solve via a for-profit, non-profit, or hybrid business</li>
		 			        <li>You must be physically present for the in-person sessions</li>
		 			        <li>You should have some supporters who believe in you and your idea</li>
		 			        <li>You should have the desire to move your idea into reality, to launch or grow your organization</li>
		 			      	</ul>
		 			        Beyond that, you do not need to be incorporated.  You do not need to have a co-founder.  You do not need to be solely focused on this business.  You do not need to know anything about business planning.

		 			        First, it helps as many entrepreneurs as possible.  Without help, more than half of all entrepreneurs fail.  They do this for a wide variety of reasons, but with some guidance, they can skip past the most common mistakes, and increase their chances of success.  Plus, within a structured program like Kick, entrepreneurs can discover far more quickly that their idea has insufficient value to turn into a company, and move on to other ideas, saving them time and money.<br>
		 			        Second, inclusivity provides an ideal due diligence process for other forms of entrepreneurial assistance.  There is simply too little information in an application and interview to determine which early-stage entrepreneurs are likely to succeed.  Watching entrepreneurs for weeks on end is far more enlightening.  Whatever your plans for the Kick graduates, you will know far better which match that need after working along side them for six weeks.
